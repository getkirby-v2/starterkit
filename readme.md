# Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## Trial

You can try Kirby on your local machine or on a test
server as long as you need to make sure it is the right
tool for your next project.

## Buy a license

You can purchase your Kirby license at
<http://getkirby.com/buy>

A Kirby license is valid for a single domain. You can find
Kirby's license agreement here: <http://getkirby.com/license>

## The Starterkit

Kirby's Starterkit comes with a small demo website and a fully
configured panel. Feel free to modify it and play with it as
much as you like.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 5.3+, Apache or Nginx.
