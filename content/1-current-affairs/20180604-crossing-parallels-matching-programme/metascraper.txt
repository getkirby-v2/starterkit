Description:

ðŸŽ“ Did you know Crossing Parallels makes TU Delft's knowledge and machinery more accessible for artists and designers?

Next to our artist-in-residency, we now host a matching programme, in which artists and designers with specific questions are matched with academics to exchange in-depth knowledge or to have practical assistance in the workshop of the Science Centre Delft.

So do you want to talk to a quantum computing expert, or an academic from one of the other inspiring departments to bring your art to the next level, contact us! ðŸ”„
