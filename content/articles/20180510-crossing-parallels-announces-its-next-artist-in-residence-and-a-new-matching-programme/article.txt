## PRESS RELEASE
Sujata perceives walls as a potential canvas. In her series ‘Concrete Abstraction’, she captures the degradation of concrete, showing a balance between natural and man-made phenomena. Seeing these photographs, Picken immediately started to interpret the patterns of degradation. Instead of a random composition, he identifies order-chaos systems in the images.

Working on the project together will provide an opportunity to turn walls into photographic plates. Instead of taking pictures of existing, worn-down concrete, they will recreate the effects and steer the process on the concrete by design. Sujata and Stephen are even aiming to go a step further by using light-sensitive coatings, to create dynamic patterns, and work with materials from wastewater treatment processes. 

## New matching programme 
New this year is Crossing Parallels’ matching programme, in which artists and designers with specific questions are matched with academics to exchange in-depth knowledge or to get practical help in the Science Centre workshop. We are pleased that, in this way, we can make TU Delft’s knowledge and machinery more accessible to artists and designers. The first artists who will be matched are Gabey Tjon a Tham and Teun Vonk.  

Crossing Parallels brings together artists and scientists to collaborate on innovative projects, stimulate future technologies, and reflect upon scientific inventions and their challenges for society at large. Starting as an artist-in-residence programme, it has developed into a platform also hosting workshops, discussion sessions and exhibitions, in order to share and discuss the parallels between art, science and technology with a broader audience. Last year’s residents were fashion designer Iris van Herpen, collaborating with Jouke Verlinden (Computer Aided Design Engineering) and artist Mike Rijnierse, working with Aurèle Adam (Optics).

## TU Delft
As one of the the world’s leading technical universities, the TU Delft seeks a broad perspective on technology. Through Crossing Parallels, artists and academics can look at technology from another angle than the strictly scientific or engineering point of view. In this way, Crossing Parallels can inspire the academic community and broaden the conversation about technology.
