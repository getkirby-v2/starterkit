Delft University of Technology and TodaysArt announce a new artist-in-residence programme

Today, the Delft University of Technology and TodaysArt reveal a new partnership: together they will launch an artist-in-residence programme. In this unique cross-disciplinary programme, residency artists and university departments will collaborate on research projects and work together towards the realization of new artworks. The results will be presented during the TodaysArt festival and other festivals and events in Europe and internationally. The pilot phase of this project will start this year with artist Mike Rijnierse teaming up with the faculty of applied sciences and fashion designer Iris van Herpen and her team working with industrial design and architecture. 

This residency programme extends and expands on the long history of collaboration and cross-pollination between art and technology, seen most clearly in the use or reflection on technology by artists. During this residency, invited artists will get the opportunity to engage in a multi-directional exchange, integrating their creativity and fresh perspectives with scientific methods and educational formats. It is precisely this exchange that lies at the heart of this programme. Art and science are disciplines which share many similarities: both are forms of research into the unknown and undiscovered and both contribute to the development of new visions. Social, cultural, economic and, above all, ethical issues are becoming more and more complex, and increasingly intertwined with one another. Collaborations between various fields of expertise are needed to deal with and engage this complexity. With a strong belief in the importance of sharing knowledge between different scientific domains, the residency has been structured with an interfaculty approach—creating a platform where scientific disciplines can come together through the intersection of art. The goal of this partnership is to connect the high quality research climate of the TU Delft with the artistic network of TodaysArt—emphasising the value of interaction and exchange among different disciplines, but also between an institute of knowledge and a creative organisation. Both partners consider this urgent and necessary act of joining forces, of opening up the university, to be an inspiring and fruitful addition to the discourses of science and art. 

TodaysArt presents urgent and topical contemporary creative expressions (both local and international) in the fields of visual (digital) art, audiovisual productions and experimental electronic music, to a wide audience. The organisation contributes to the makers climate and the infrastructure of talent development, both in art and the creative industry, through commissions and cross-sector collaborations. TodaysArt is thrilled to have the opportunity to share knowledge and network with the TU Delft.
