Text: Mike Rijnierse (1974) is an artist, performer and educator working in the fields of light, sound and architecture. He is intrigued by sensory experience, whether visual, acoustic, spatial, or cross-senses and synesthesia, creating installations, performances, public interventions, often collaborating with other disciplines. Rijnierse has exhibited his works throughout Europe, Korea, Taiwan, Morocco, The United Arab Emirates and Brazil in various contexts, from media art festivals, to galleries, museums and interventions in the public space. As a docent since 2009 at Interaction Design department of [ArtEZ](http://www.interactiefarnhem.nl/), Arnhem, Rijnierse has devised the course Design of Instruments, where students research and create instruments that transcend technological domains, exploring new and obsolete media.
