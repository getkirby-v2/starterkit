Photographer Sujata Majumdar is the newest artist-in-residence at Crossing Parallels, TodaysArt and TU Delft’s joint platform. Over the coming months, Sujata will collaborate with Stephen Picken, professor of Polymer Materials, on the project ‘A Cure for Concrete’. Together they will experiment with nanocoatings, such as Picken’s ‘Delft Green Curing Compound’, to explore the pictorial potential of concrete.

Sujata perceives walls as a potential canvas. In her series ‘Concrete Abstraction’, she captures the degradation of concrete, showing a balance between natural and man-made phenomena. Seeing these photographs, Picken immediately started to interpret the patterns of degradation. Instead of a random composition, he identifies order-chaos systems in the images.

Working on the project together will provide an opportunity to turn walls into photographic plates. Instead of taking pictures of existing, worn-down concrete, they will recreate the effects and steer the process on the concrete by design. Sujata and Stephen are even aiming to go a step further by using light-sensitive coatings, to create dynamic patterns, and work with materials from wastewater treatment processes.
